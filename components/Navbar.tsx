"use client";

/*
  components/Navbar.tsx — The Navigation Bar
  
  ============================================================
  "use client" — WHAT DOES THIS DO?
  ============================================================
  
  This directive at the TOP of the file (must be line 1, before
  any imports) tells Next.js: "this component runs in the browser,
  not on the server."
  
  We need it here because:
  1. We use useState (tracks whether the mobile menu is open)
  2. We use event handlers (onClick for the hamburger button)
  3. We check the current URL (usePathname hook) to highlight
     the active nav link — this requires knowing what's in the browser
  
  All three of those require a browser to exist. Server components
  run before the browser is involved, so they can't do any of this.
  
  RULE OF THUMB:
  Ask yourself: "Does this component need to know what the user
  is doing RIGHT NOW?" If yes → "use client".
  
  ============================================================
  REACT NATIVE EQUIVALENT
  ============================================================
  
  In RN, the closest equivalent to this Navbar is a custom header
  component or a Tab Navigator. The key differences:
  
  RN navigation:  defined in a navigator, rendered by React Navigation
  Web navigation: just a regular component with <Link> tags. No
                  special navigator system needed. The URL IS the state.
  
  ============================================================
  MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH
  ============================================================
  
  Since our users will often be on their phones while playing,
  we design for mobile FIRST and layer on desktop styles.
  
  Tailwind's responsive prefixes work like this:
    (no prefix)  → applies at ALL screen sizes (mobile first)
    md:          → applies at 768px and wider
    lg:          → applies at 1024px and wider
  
  So `hidden md:flex` means:
    → hidden on mobile
    → flex on medium screens and up
  
  This is the OPPOSITE of how many RN devs think (starting
  from desktop and adding mobile breakpoints). Tailwind is
  mobile-first by convention.
